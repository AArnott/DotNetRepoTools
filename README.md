  upgrade <id> <version>          Upgrade a package dependency, and all transitive dependencies such that no package downgrade warnings occur.
  trim                            Removes PackageReference items that are redundant because they are to packages that already appear as transitive
                                  dependencies.
  ManagePackageVersionsCentrally  Migrates a repo to use centralized package versions.
```

and

Commands:
  trim <mergeTarget>  Removes local branches that have already been merged into some target ref.
```

## Example usage

For example, the following command will upgrade the repo's Directory.Packages.props file to consume a new version of a particular package,
and update all transitive dependencies that also have versions specified in that file, so that you do not have to manually upgrade those versions
to resolve package downgrade errors:

    repo nuget upgrade StreamJsonRpc 1.2.3

Or the command I use most frequently, which cleans up all your stale local branches:

    repo git trim origin/main
